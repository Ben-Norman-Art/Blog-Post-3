While in battle as it is good to always have the upperhand it is also wise to sacrifice pieces to rally for your next move. Gain victory once all enemy team's army is vanquished.

<p class="Group, TabTwo" style="color:white">Me and my partner started the game off with a simple chess board and decided to add pieces for the players are able to control. The players would then also have a maximum of 5 cards in their hand. We decided to limit ourselves to a number of six pieces, which was enough that was able to fit on the board. We placed the pieces and was trying to figure out exactly how to make the pieces move, so I came up with the idea that the player should roll a dice. The first dice roll to determine which piece moves to their corresponding number and the second dice roll would determine how many spaces the player was able to move. The player would be able to move in any direction as they pleased. We soon decided to have the players interact, so we decided when both player's pieces are on the same space a battle will commence. We first decided that the players would play their highest card, King being the highest, but we then decided to make the change to have the players decide which card they are able to play. The understanding of how to gain or replenish came into question so me and my partner decided to have the player that loses a piece is able to replenish their cards to equal back to 5 cards and the winner wasn't able to replenish their hand but they are able to discard a card in their hand for future uses.

With my second Game Session, I decided to play with one of friends and see how they would like to play and see if there were any mistakes. With the new map, I wanted to incorporate specific movements, with the second dice roll determining which direction horizontally, vertically or diagonally. I was unable to do that due to the spaces being a hexagon and not a octagon prevented the players from moving horizontally. The game went by smooth and my friend did not seem to find any problem with it but I still decided to add more things to the game and add more to the rules.

With the final Game Session, Me and my partner played with the previous game session board but with the added rules I applied. I wanted to add a special ability players were able to use once they roll two of a kind during their first and second roll. (Ex. if a player rolls a 1 on both rolls they were able to roll a third time to add to their movement) When playing the game we were barely able to see the abilities be produced within the game. My partner did recommend to change or get rid of some of the abilities but I decided to keep them in. I wasn't able to see how the game would have been with the new board that I made but I think it would be interesting if the game was played with the maximum of 8 player like intended.
